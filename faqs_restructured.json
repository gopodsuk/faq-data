  {
    "question": "Who are Go-Pods suited to?",
    "answer": "We have a wide and diverse range of customers who are drawn to the Go-Pods for a number of reasons.<br><br>• Many of our customers are upgrading from tent camping.<br>• Lots of Go-Pod customers have downsized from larger, traditional touring caravans as they appreciate the convenience and ease of use in comparison. Being able to store the Go-Pod at home is a common factor in the decision of those customers.<br>• Solo travellers who don't need the space of larger caravans.<br>• Caravan enthusiasts in the 60 + age bracket, who may find it difficult to manage large caravans.<br>• Those with vehicles with small engines that are unable to tow heavy caravans.<br>• Professionals with limited spare time, who love the idea of being able to head off on adventures with short notice.<br>• These are just a few, limited examples of our customers. The truth is that anyone of any age can benefit from a Go-Pod!",

  {
    "question": "What are the main advantages of Go-Pods vs other caravans?",
    "answer": "• The one-piece GRP fibreglass shell has no seams or joins, unlike traditional caravans which are built with separate panels. This means that there is very little possibility of water ingress and damage.<br>• The GRP fibreglass shell is extremely lightweight, providing greater fuel economy and allowing the Go-Pod to be towed with smaller cars.<br>• The shape of the body is aerodynamic, so there is little wind resistance.<br>• Go-Pods are small in size, so they are easy to store and fit inside of most standard garages.<br>• They feature a seating area which can be converted to a double bed, saving space and allowing different configurations.<br>• Many of the components are suitable for use without access to 230v electricity supply, so the Go-Pod can be used 'off-grid' - this can save money on pitches at campsites, and also allows the Go-Pod to reach locations that other caravans cannot.<br>• There are multiple options for customisation, including 3 furniture colours, multiple fabric options and the ability to colour match the body to any RAL paint code.<br>• Go-Pods are very easy to service and maintain, requiring far less annual maintenance than other caravans.<br>• There is a thriving community of Go-Pod owners online, from a number of countries. This is an invaluable resource and owners are always happy to provide advice and assistance to each other.",

    "answer": "Go-Pods will fit comfortably in most standard size garages, meaning they can be stored at home, saving money on storage fees.<br><br>At only 4.20m in length, they are roughly the size of a standard hatchback car, so some customers store them in residential parking spaces and underground garages.",
