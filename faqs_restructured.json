    "question": "Who are Go-Pods suited to?",
    "answer": "We have a wide and diverse range of customers who are drawn to the Go-Pods for a number of reasons.<br><br>• Many of our customers are upgrading from tent camping.<br>• Lots of Go-Pod customers have downsized from larger, traditional touring caravans as they appreciate the convenience and ease of use in comparison. Being able to store the Go-Pod at home is a common factor in the decision of those customers.<br>• Solo travellers who don't need the space of larger caravans.<br>• Caravan enthusiasts in the 60 + age bracket, who may find it difficult to manage large caravans.<br>• Those with vehicles with small engines that are unable to tow heavy caravans.<br>• Professionals with limited spare time, who love the idea of being able to head off on adventures with short notice.<br>• These are just a few, limited examples of our customers. The truth is that anyone of any age can benefit from a Go-Pod!",

  {
    "question": "What are the main advantages of Go-Pods vs other caravans?",
    "answer": "• The one-piece GRP fibreglass shell has no seams or joins, unlike traditional caravans which are built with separate panels. This means that there is very little possibility of water ingress and damage.<br>• The GRP fibreglass shell is extremely lightweight, providing greater fuel economy and allowing the Go-Pod to be towed with smaller cars.<br>• The shape of the body is aerodynamic, so there is little wind resistance.<br>• Go-Pods are small in size, so they are easy to store and fit inside of most standard garages.<br>• They feature a seating area which can be converted to a double bed, saving space and allowing different configurations.<br>• Many of the components are suitable for use without access to 230v electricity supply, so the Go-Pod can be used 'off-grid' - this can save money on pitches at campsites, and also allows the Go-Pod to reach locations that other caravans cannot.<br>• There are multiple options for customisation, including 3 furniture colours, multiple fabric options and the ability to colour match the body to any RAL paint code.<br>• Go-Pods are very easy to service and maintain, requiring far less annual maintenance than other caravans.<br>• There is a thriving community of Go-Pod owners online, from a number of countries. This is an invaluable resource and owners are always happy to provide advice and assistance to each other.",

    "question": "Can Go-Pods be used throughout the year?",
    "answer": "They certainly can!<br><br>With around 1.5 - 2cm of insulation, the Go-Pods are incredibly effective at maintaining a constant temperature.<br><br>Dual-fuel blown air heating systems are available as an optional extra. They run on either gas or 240V mains electricity, meaning that they can be used on or off-grid.",

  {
    "question": "Where can I store a Go-Pod?",
    "answer": "Go-Pods will fit comfortably in most standard size garages, meaning they can be stored at home, saving money on storage fees.<br><br>At only 4.20m in length, they are roughly the size of a standard hatchback car, so some customers store them in residential parking spaces and underground garages.",

  {
    "question": "How are Go-Pods manufactured?",
    "answer": "Go-Pods are relatively unique caravans, as they have a one-piece GRP fibreglass shell with no seams or joins. This prevents water ingress and extends the longevity of the caravan.<br><br>Our patented shell design is produced by a fibreglass manufacturer using a mould. Fibreglass is poured into the mould and allowed to set. A gel coat is applied atop the fibreglass shell to provide an attractive finish.<br><br>We build the body of the Go-Pods at our factory, using a galvanised steel chassis as the base. We then place the shell onto the chassis, and begin fitting the interior of the Go-Pod.<br><br>The frame is constructed with wood (which helps to keep the weight down) and the cavities are filled with medium density polystyrene insulation blocks. This helps to retain heat in the colder months, and keep the Go-Pod cool during the summer months. White lacquered MDF wall panels are then placed over the frame and insulation.<br><br>The floor (and under-floor) is made from marine-grade plywood, which is water resistant and helps to prevent against water ingress from road water. It is securely sealed around the edges using high quality caravan sealant.<br><br>Interior furniture units are made from strong poplar plywood.",

    "category": "Technical questions"
  },
  {
    "question": "What towing equipment is required?",
    "answer": "You need a standard 50mm diameter tow ball and 13 pin Euro socket electrics.<br><br>This socket will accept the Go-Pods 13 pin plug which works the towing lights, charges the caravan's on-board battery and powers the fridge in transit.<br><br>If your tow vehicle has twin electrics you can buy an adaptor to convert the leads. If you have only 7 pin electrics on your car, you can still tow with an adaptor but it will only operate the driving lights & won't power anything else.<br><br>You do not require an AL-KO branded tow bar and non branded tow bars are fine to fit.",
    "category": "Technical questions"
  },
  {
    "question": "Do I need extended towing mirrors?",
    "answer": "The Law requires that drivers of the towing vehicles have adequate view to the rear. With the Go-Pod, most vehicles existing side mirrors allow for a good view along the entire side of the caravan and extension mirrors are not therefore required. ",
