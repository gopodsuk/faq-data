    "answer": "<p>Go-Pods offer many advantages over other micro tourers, lightweight leisure vehicles, and traditional caravans. Here are just a few:</p>\n  <ul>\n    <li>The one-piece GRP fibreglass shell has no seams or joins, unlike traditional caravans built with separate panels. This means there's very little possibility of water ingress or damage.</li>\n    <li>The GRP fibreglass shell is extremely lightweight, providing greater fuel economy and allowing the Go-Pod to be towed with smaller cars.</li>\n    <li>The aerodynamic body shape reduces wind resistance.</li>\n    <li>Go-Pods are compact and easy to store-fitting inside most standard garages. The seating area converts into a double bed, saving space and allowing flexible configurations.</li>\n    <li>Many components can be used without access to a 230v supply, allowing 'off-grid' use. This saves money on campsite pitches and enables travel to locations that other caravans can't reach.</li>\n    <li>There are multiple options for aesthetic customisation-furniture and fabric colours, custom gel coat colours, vinyl graphics, and more.</li>\n    <li>Go-Pods are easy to service and maintain, requiring far less annual maintenance than most caravans.</li>\n    <li>There's a thriving community of Go-Pod owners worldwide-an invaluable resource where members gladly share advice and assistance.</li>\n  </ul>\n  <p>If you'd like to read about the specific advantages of a Go-Pod versus a small campervan (e.g. Volkswagen T5 models), click the button below.</p>\n  <div class=\"faq-buttons\">\n    <a href=\"https://www.go-pods.co.uk/camper-van-alternative\" class=\"btn\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Go-Pods vs Camper Vans</a>\n  </div>\n</div>\n"

    "question": "What is a \"motor mover\" and what does it do?",
    "category": "General questions",
    "images": "",
    "answer": "<p>A motor mover is an electrical, mechanical unit that allows you to manoeuvre a caravan using a remote control.</p>\n\n<h4>This is how it works:</h4>\n<p>Units are installed at either end of the axle(s), beside the wheels. Cogs engage and press against the wheels of your caravan. When you press directional buttons on the remote control, the cogs move either backwards or forwards, depending on the buttons you press.</p>\n<p>This allows you to move your caravan backwards, forwards, turn in either direction, or move diagonally.</p>\n<p>We install the Powrtouch Freedom automatic motor mover units on Go-Pods.</p>\n\n<h4>What's the difference between a manual and automatic motor mover?</h4>\n<p>The only difference is how the cogs engage with the wheels of your caravan. Manual versions require you to use a winder or crank to move the cogs from their resting position to engage with the wheels, whereas automatic versions take care of this process for you when activated.</p>\n<p>Manual versions are usually <em>slightly</em> cheaper, but there isn't a huge difference in cost.</p>\n\n<div class=\"faq-buttons\">\n  <a href=\"https://www.go-pods.co.uk/powrtouch-automatic-motor-mover\" class=\"btn\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Motor mover guide</a>\n</div>"

    "question": "Do Go-Pods come with a warranty?",
    "category": "Ordering a Go-Pod",

    "answer": "<p>They do indeed!</p>\n<p>Go-Pods purchased directly from us include a 12-month back-to-base warranty as standard. There is also the option to upgrade this to a 36-month nationwide warranty for &pound;399.00.</p>\n<p>Go-Pod Pioneer models include the 36-month nationwide warranty as standard.</p>\n\n<h4>What's the difference between the \"back-to-base\" warranty and the 36-month nationwide version?</h4>\n<p>\"Back-to-base\" means that, in the event of a warranty claim, you'd need to bring your Go-Pod back to us for the work to be completed.</p>\n<p>The nationwide warranty is administered by a third-party company, The Motoring Organisation. In the event of a warranty claim, you'd contact them directly and they will arrange for the necessary work to be completed at a local approved workshop. In some cases (for example, if the caravan isn't safe for towing) they'll even arrange for your Go-Pod to be collected and delivered back to you after the work is completed.</p>\n\n<h4>Do any of the individual appliances or components include their own warranty?</h4>\n<p>Yes, many of the components and appliances fitted in Go-Pods include their own warranties. For example, the sink/hob units and refrigerators are manufactured by Dometic and include manufacturer-backed warranties.</p>\n<p>If any of these components were to fail, you should contact us and we'll lodge a warranty claim with our supplier, who will in turn lodge it with the manufacturer. Usually, our supplier will obtain a warranty replacement from the manufacturer and send it to us, and we'll book your Go-Pod into our workshop to install the replacement.</p>\n\n<div class=\"faq-buttons\">\n  <a href=\"https://www.go-pods.co.uk/downloads\" class=\"btn\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Warranty documents</a>\n</div>"

    "question": "How are Go-Pods manufactured?",
    "category": "Technical questions",

    "answer": "<p>Go-Pods are relatively unique caravans, as they have a one-piece GRP fibreglass shell with no seams or joins. This prevents water ingress and extends the longevity of the caravan.</p>\n<p>Our patented shell design is produced by a fibreglass manufacturer using a mould. Fibreglass is poured into the mould and allowed to set. A gel coat is applied atop the fibreglass shell to provide an aesthetically pleasing finish.</p>\n<p>We build the body of the Go-Pods at our factory, using a galvanised steel chassis as the base. We then place the shell onto the chassis and begin fitting the interior of the Go-Pod.</p>\n<p>The frame is constructed with wood (which helps to keep the weight down) and the cavities are filled with medium density polystyrene insulation blocks. This helps to retain heat in the colder months, and keep the Go-Pod cool during the summer months. White lacquered MDF wall panels are then placed over the frame and insulation.</p>\n<p>The floor (and under-floor) is made from marine-grade plywood, which is water resistant and helps to prevent against water ingress from road water. It is securely sealed around the edges using high quality caravan sealant.</p>\n<p>Interior furniture units are made from strong poplar plywood.</p>"

    "question": "Can my car tow a Go-Pod?",
    "category": "Technical questions",

    "answer": "<p>The vast majority of vehicles can tow a Go-Pod with ease, thanks to their low overall weight and aerodynamic shape.</p>\n<p>With a maximum weight (MTPLM) of just 750&nbsp;kg and a factory standard weight (MiRO) of 580&nbsp;kg, almost any vehicle can tow a Go-Pod - including small hatchbacks, EVs, and even some trikes.</p>\n\n<h4>Check if your vehicle is suitable for towing a Go-Pod:</h4>\n\n<h5>Method 1 - V5C / logbook</h5>\n<p>This is the easiest way to check if your vehicle is capable of towing a Go-Pod <em>(or any caravan, for that matter)</em>.</p>\n<p>Open your green V5C (logbook) document for your vehicle and look on the first inside page. Under the heading <strong><em>\"O: Technical permissible maximum towable mass of trailer\"</em></strong>, find the sub-heading <strong><em>\"O.1: braked (kg)\"</em></strong>.</p>\n<p>As long as the figure displayed next to this sub-heading is 750&nbsp;kg or more, your car can tow a Go-Pod.</p>\n\n<h5>Method 2 - VIN plate</h5>\n<p>If you don't have your V5C to hand, you can manually calculate your towing allowance by checking the VIN plate of your vehicle.</p>\n<p>This is a metal-stamped plate, usually affixed to the inside of either the engine compartment or one of the door openings. On the VIN plate, three figures (in kilograms) will be displayed:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>The first figure is the <strong><em>Gross Vehicle Weight</em></strong> - the total weight of your vehicle, unladen.</li>\n  <li>The second figure is the <strong><em>Gross Train Weight</em></strong> - the maximum allowed weight of your vehicle and a trailer, both fully laden.</li>\n  <li>The third figure is the <strong><em>Axle Weight</em></strong> - not relevant for what we're trying to achieve.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To calculate the braked towing allowance of your vehicle, simply subtract the <strong><em>Gross Vehicle Weight</em></strong> from the <strong><em>Gross Train Weight</em></strong>.</p>"
